"""Durable conversation checkpointer (SQLite) for the agent graph.

LangGraph needs the checkpointer bound at **compile time** so multi-turn chats
keep their history per ``thread_id``. Two constraints shape the choice here:

- The graph is compiled **synchronously at boot**, before uvicorn starts the
  event loop — so an aiosqlite-based ``AsyncSqliteSaver`` (which wants a running
  loop at construction/setup) is an awkward fit.
- The agent runs **async**, and the stock sync ``SqliteSaver`` raises
  ``NotImplementedError`` on the async methods the agent graph calls.

So we wrap the sync ``SqliteSaver`` and delegate its async methods to worker
threads via ``asyncio.to_thread``: synchronous construction (no loop needed),
loop-agnostic at call time, durable on disk. The saver serializes access with
its own lock and ``check_same_thread=False``, which keeps the cross-thread
``to_thread`` calls safe.

# busy_timeout — the incremental pruner mid-VACUUM, or two background turns
# landing at once — still surfaces a ``database is locked`` OperationalError.

# A locked write commits nothing, so a bounded retry with short exponential
