"""Owned-lifetime ActiveTaskRegistry — retires producer/consumer tasks at turn teardown.

Port of protoAgent #1713 (a2a-sdk 1.1.0 bug, upstream a2aproject/a2a-python#1121 /
#1123): at the end of a turn the SDK's ``ActiveTask`` teardown drops the last external
strong reference to the still-*pending* ``producer:<task_id>`` asyncio task without
cancelling or awaiting it:

1. On the terminal event the consumer sets ``_is_finished`` and shuts the request queue
   while the producer is still pending (``active_task.py:299-306``).
2. The producer wakes into its ``finally`` and parks at
   ``await self._event_queue_subscribers.close(immediate=False)`` (``active_task.py:566``
   — the exact line in the production tracebacks), an await the SDK itself documents as
   a deadlock risk when unconsumed events remain (``event_queue_v2.py:214-217``).
3. The consumer's ``finally`` drops the refcount to 0 and fires ``_on_cleanup`` →
   ``ActiveTaskRegistry._remove_task`` pops the ``ActiveTask`` from the registry dict —
   the only external strong reference — *without* touching ``_producer_task``.
4. The pending producer is now reachable only through the reference island
   ``ActiveTask._producer_task ↔ producer-coro.self``; cyclic GC collects it →
   ``ERROR asyncio Task was destroyed but it is pending!``, clustering at turn
   completions.

The real fix belongs upstream (strong-ref + cancel/await the producer in the SDK's own
teardown). Until that ships, this module contains it from the host side: a registry
subclass whose cleanup path *owns* the ActiveTask's background tasks for their full
lifetime — it holds a strong reference, gives the producer a short grace period to flush
naturally, then cancels and awaits it, so pending work either completes or fails loudly
(a logged warning) instead of being silently destroyed by the garbage collector.

This intentionally reaches into a2a-sdk private attributes (``_producer_task``,
``_consumer_task``, ``_active_task_registry``) — there is no public seam: protoPen
supplies only the ``AgentExecutor``, and the producer task is created inside
``ActiveTask.start()``. Every access is guarded so an SDK upgrade that moves the
internals degrades to a logged warning + stock behavior, never a crash. Re-verify (and
ideally delete this module) when bumping past a2a-sdk 1.1.0 — see the upstream issues.
