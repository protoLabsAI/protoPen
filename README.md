# protoPen

Autonomous Security Research & Pen-Testing Agent

A LangGraph-powered agent that runs on a Steam Deck with attached RF/WiFi/RFID peripherals. It combines real-time threat intelligence — CVE tracking, exploit monitoring, security feed aggregation — with hardware-in-the-loop pen testing using PortaPack H4M, Flipper Zero, WiFi Marauder, and BlackArch tools. All findings flow into a hybrid-search knowledge store (SQLite + sqlite-vec + FTS5) and are correlated across sensors automatically.

## What it does

protoPen is a single agent that covers the full offensive and defensive
spectrum, then correlates everything it finds into one knowledge store. The
exact tool set is generated live in [Tools](#tools); the domains it spans:

- **Threat intelligence** — CVE tracking (NVD/MITRE), Exploit-DB and security
  feed monitoring, GitHub trend watching, hybrid-search knowledge store
- **Reconnaissance & enumeration** — passive OSINT, external/perimeter footprint,
  DNS and subdomain discovery, network/service/web enumeration
- **Vulnerability assessment** — web, API, auth, GraphQL/gRPC, SSRF, injection,
  and CVE matching
- **Exploitation & post-exploitation** — Metasploit, credential attacks, privilege
  escalation, lateral movement, persistence, Active Directory, evasion, phishing
- **Wireless, RF & hardware** — WiFi (deauth, PMKID, evil portal, karma), Sub-GHz
  RF capture/replay, NFC/RFID, BLE — via PortaPack, Flipper, Marauder, and an Alfa
  adapter
- **Specialized domains** — IoT/OT protocols, mobile, telecom, serverless, CI/CD,
  supply chain, LLM/AI, and container/Kubernetes security
- **Blue & purple team** — CIS benchmarks, service hardening, anomaly detection,
  incident response, and MITRE ATT&CK coverage mapping
- **Operations** — risk-gated engagement modes, OPSEC controls, playbooks, the
  local scheduler, Discord publishing, and an Agent-to-Agent (A2A) endpoint
- **Observability** — Langfuse tracing, Prometheus metrics, JSONL audit trail

### Subagents

- **Security Research** — Threat Scanner (feed monitoring), Vuln Analyst (advisory
  analysis + target correlation), Intel Reporter (digests + Discord publishing)
- **Pen Testing** — Recon (passive enumeration), Exploit (active testing), Reporter
  (finding synthesis + reports)
- **Blue Team** — Defender (CIS/hardening), Incident Responder (correlation/IR),
  Purple Team (red↔blue detection-gap analysis)

## Hardware

| Device | Role |
|---|---|
| **Steam Deck** | Compute platform — runs the agent, tools, and knowledge store |
| **PortaPack H4M** | HackRF One + Mayhem firmware — RF capture/replay/transmit (1 MHz–6 GHz) |
| **Flipper Zero** | Multi-tool — Sub-GHz, NFC, RFID, IR, BLE, GPIO |
| **WiFi Marauder (ESP32)** | WiFi attacks — scan, deauth, PMKID capture, evil portal, karma AP |

| **BlackArch Tools** | nmap, tshark, nikto, gobuster, hashcat, john, sqlmap, hydra, etc. |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

protoPen routes LLM calls through a LiteLLM gateway. Set the gateway key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<litellm-master-key>   # required — LiteLLM gateway auth
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...          # optional — direct Anthropic access
```

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoPen
cd protoPen

# Start (basic mode)
docker compose up --build
# UI at http://localhost:7872
```

### Local

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py --port 7870
```

## Tools

The catalog below is generated from the live tool registry
(`get_combined_tools()`) by `scripts/gen_tool_docs.py` — adding or removing a
tool updates it automatically. Run `python scripts/gen_tool_docs.py` after
changing the tool set; CI fails if it drifts. Deeper, hand-written detail for
the external-attack tools follows in [External Attack Simulation](#external-attack-simulation).

### External Attack Simulation

Simulates a real external attacker with no prior access — passive footprint first, then active perimeter assault. All WAN-facing scans route through a configured external pivot (`PIVOT_HOST` env) to ensure results reflect a genuine outside-in view rather than hairpin NAT artifacts.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `external_recon` | Passive external footprint: WAN IP discovery, Shodan/Censys host intelligence, BGP/ASN ownership, certificate transparency (crt.sh subdomain enumeration), DNS security posture (SPF/DKIM/DMARC/CAA), cloud storage exposure (S3/Azure/GCS). `SHODAN_API_KEY` enables API mode; falls back to Shodan CLI if absent. |
| `perimeter_audit` | Active perimeter assault: router fingerprinting (banner/SNMP/web UI), UPnP device discovery and unauthenticated port-mapping abuse, default credential testing, RouterSploit autopwn, WAN port scan (parallel SYN+ACK via SSH pivot), DNS rebinding check, firewall egress mapping. |

#### `perimeter_audit` actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `router_fingerprint` | Banner grab, HTTP/HTTPS web UI title, SNMP community string enumeration |
| `upnp_discover` | SSDP broadcast — find all UPnP devices including the IGD |
| `upnp_portmap` | List existing UPnP port-forwarding rules (what's already exposed on WAN) |
| `upnp_add_portmap` | Test whether the IGD accepts unauthenticated port mapping additions |
| `default_creds` | Spray common ISP default credentials against router admin interface |
| `routersploit_scan` | RouterSploit autopwn — tests all known router CVEs against the gateway |
| `wan_portscan` | Parallel SYN+ACK scan of WAN IP via SSH pivot — reports all port states (open/filtered/closed), not just open. Includes ISP management ports (4567, 7547, 9443). |
| `tcp_probe` | **Deep TCP flag analysis** on specific ports via `hping3` + `nmap -sA/-sF/-sN` battery. Distinguishes: `FIN+ACK` (IP-allowlisted ISP/CPE management — port is live but rejects non-ISP source IPs), `RST` (closed), `SYN+ACK` (open), silence (stateful firewall drop). Run this when Shodan shows a port indexed but nmap reports it filtered. |
| `acs_fingerprint` | Probe ISP/CPE management infrastructure: TR-069 CWMP (7547), proprietary ACS (4567), Lumen Tungsten HTTPS (9443), Huawei HG (30005). Banner-grabs each port and correlates rDNS with known ISP management architectures (CenturyLink/Lumen, Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox). |
| `dns_rebind_check` | Test whether the router blocks DNS rebinding attacks |
| `firewall_egress` | Test which outbound ports pass through the firewall (C2 channel assessment) |
| `full_perimeter` | Run all checks in parallel. Includes `tcp_probe` + `acs_fingerprint` automatically when `external_ip`/`pivot_host` is provided. |

#### External pivot

WAN-facing actions (`wan_portscan`, `tcp_probe`, `acs_fingerprint`) **strongly recommend an external pivot** for public IPs — scanning from the local host traverses hairpin NAT and produces unreliable results. Without a pivot the tool warns and proceeds locally (useful only if the host is externally routed). Set the pivot once and all tools use it automatically:

```bash
# systemd drop-in (persistent across restarts)
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/protopen.service.d/
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/protopen.service.d/pivot.conf <<EOF
[Service]
Environment=PIVOT_HOST=root@your-vps-ip
EOF
systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart protopen
```

Or set in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
environment:
  - PIVOT_HOST=root@your-vps-ip
```

The pivot needs `nmap`, `hping3`, `nc`, `bash`, and `timeout` — plus SSH access. Any external VPS works (AWS, DigitalOcean, Vultr — or a Tailscale-connected host).

#### Playbooks

Two new playbooks for end-to-end external attack simulation:

| Playbook | Steps | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `external_recon` | 13 | Passive footprint: WAN IP → Shodan → BGP/ASN → cert transparency → DNS security → subdomain enum → OSINT → cloud exposure → SSL audit |
| `perimeter_attack` | 14 | Active assault: router fingerprint → UPnP abuse → default creds → RouterSploit → WAN port scan → **TCP flag analysis** → **ACS fingerprint** → CVE correlation |

## Engagement Modes

| Mode | Level | Allows |
|---|---|---|
| **PASSIVE** | 0 | Listen, scan, enumerate. No transmission. |
| **ACTIVE** | 1 | Active probing, PMKID capture, signal replay, vuln scan |
| **REDTEAM** | 2 | Deauth, evil portal, karma AP, BLE spam, brute force |

The agent does not auto-escalate modes. If it needs a higher mode, it reports the requirement and waits for explicit human instruction.

```python
from playbooks.loader import load_playbook
from playbooks.runner import run_playbook

pb = load_playbook("defensive_assessment", {"target": "192.168.4.1"})
result = await run_playbook(pb, dispatch)
```


## API

### Chat API

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:7872/api/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What are the latest critical CVEs affecting Linux?"}'
```

### OpenAI-Compatible API

```bash
curl http://localhost:7872/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "protopen",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Search for recent RCE vulnerabilities in network equipment"}]
  }'
```

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent)

`message/send` returns immediately with a `submitted` task — long-running ops run in the background.

```bash
# Submit a task (returns in <1s)
TASK=$(curl -s -X POST http://steamdeck:7870/a2a \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "message/send",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Run a passive recon of 192.168.1.0/24"}]
      }
    }
  }' | jq -r '.result.id')

# Poll until completed
curl http://steamdeck:7870/tasks/$TASK | jq '.status.state,.artifacts[0].parts[0].text'
```

Or stream progress in real-time via SSE (first frame is always `submitted`):

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://steamdeck:7870/message:stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":{"parts":[{"kind":"text","text":"Passive recon 192.168.1.0/24"}]}}'
```

See the [A2A Integration guide](docs/guides/a2a-integration.md) for full details: polling, streaming, push notifications, and task cancellation.

## Knowledge Search

Hybrid search combining vector similarity (Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B via sqlite-vec) with BM25 keyword matching (SQLite FTS5), fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Searches across advisories, exploits, threat intel, and digests.

**Search modes** (configurable in `langgraph-config.yaml`):
- `hybrid` (default) — RRF fusion of vector + keyword results
- `vector` — semantic similarity only
- `keyword` — BM25 keyword matching only
